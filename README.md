# ithem should be a super-minimalistic CMS
# The project it's been active since few days, so there is almost nothing now.
# ithem works with a single table containing items and relative attributes.
# at the moment there is no back-end and no styling options yet: just loops and returns.
# Unfortunately, no one can be told what *ithem* is. You have to see it for yourself. (quote)
#
# So.. Installation guide is almost simple:
# 1. Get the code and put it on a LAMP webserver
# 2. Import the provided test-db on your machine
